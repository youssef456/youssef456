# 👋 Hi, I'm Youssef Asaad  
### Software Engineer | Python Backend Developer | Full-Stack | ML & AI Enthusiast

I’m a Software Engineer specializing in **Python, Backend Engineering, Cloud Deployment, and Machine Learning**.  
I enjoy building real products — from SaaS features and APIs to computer-vision systems, automation tools, and mobile apps.

Currently, I’m working at **Trufla Technology (Canada-based SaaS company)** where I contribute to backend development, API logic, debugging production systems, and supporting cloud deployments (AWS, Docker, Linux).

I'm actively developing my expertise in **ML/AI**, focusing on data preprocessing, model experimentation, and computer vision.
