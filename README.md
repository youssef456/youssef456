# 👋 Hi, I'm Youssef Asaad  
### Software Engineer | Python Backend Developer | Full-Stack | ML & AI Enthusiast

I’m a Software Engineer specializing in **Python, Backend Engineering, Cloud Deployment, and Machine Learning**.  
I enjoy building real products — from SaaS features and APIs to computer-vision systems, automation tools, and AI-powered applications.

Currently, I work at **Trufla Technology (Canada-based SaaS company)**, where I contribute to backend development, API logic, debugging production systems, and supporting cloud deployments using **AWS, Docker, and Linux**.

Alongside my professional work, I’m actively developing my expertise in **ML & AI**, focusing on hands-on projects involving NLP, transformers, AI agents, and computer vision.
